## ðŸš€ About Me: Bridging Front-End Brilliance with a Passion for Ethical Hacking 
Greetings! I'm a Front-End Developer with an insatiable curiosity for the world of hacking. My journey began in the realm of web development, where I craft seamless and visually captivating user interfaces using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React. However, my passion extends beyond pixels and codeâ€”I harbor a profound interest in ethical hacking. With a commitment to cybersecurity, I constantly explore the dynamic intersection between creative design and secure functionality. Leveraging my skills in both arenas, I strive to build digital experiences that not only captivate users but also withstand the ever-evolving landscape of cybersecurity challenges.
