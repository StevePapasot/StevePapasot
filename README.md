## ðŸš€ About Me: Bridging Front-End Brilliance with a Passion for Ethical Hacking 
Hello! Iâ€™m a 26-year-old tech enthusiast with a Bachelor's degree in Educational Electrical Engineering, driven by a deep passion for technology, digital defense, and lifelong learning. My journey began in web development and gradually evolved into cybersecurity, where I found my true callingâ€”protecting systems, detecting threats, and securing digital environments. Currently I am working as L1 SOC analyst but the previous years I have been working as a WordPress Developer.
